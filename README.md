# Hi there, I'm Brisa! üëã

I'm a **Bioengineer** by education (in process, hopefully by next July) and a **Software Engineer** by experience. I'm passionate about leveraging technology to enhance healthcare. I currently work at **Solvd** as a team lead on my project, where I focus on software development and team collaboration. With a commitment to problem-solving, I aim to create impactful solutions. I'm hoping to gain more hard skills experience and, someday, apply it in healthcare tech development.

## üéì Education
- **Bioengineer, Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de Buenos Aires, Argentina**  
  Throughout my studies, I have had the opportunity to create several interesting projects that bridge engineering and healthcare.

  I developed a web-based MVP electronic data capture system (EDC) for clinical trial management, streamlining data collection and enhancing research efficiency.

  Additionally, I created a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) for scoliosis diagnosis based on X-ray column segmentation, aiding healthcare professionals in making informed decisions.

  I also worked on projects involving image and signal processing and machine learning, distinguishing movements through electromyography data. This work could lead to innovative solutions like real-time translation from signals to speech, which would be transformative for communication in healthcare.

  Currently, I am working on my thesis, which focuses on a phantom head for EEG and electrophysiology simulations and investigations. This project includes signal generation with Arduino and a desktop platform for managing control and visualizing results, further integrating technology into healthcare applications.

## ü§ù Volunteering
- In my free time, I lead a diverse team at the **IEEE ITBA Student Branch**, part of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), which is a global organization dedicated to advancing technology for humanity. At IEEE ITBA, we organize programming courses and tech competitions, fostering skill development and collaboration among students. It‚Äôs a fantastic way to engage with the community, learn new things, and inspire others in the field of technology!

## üå± What I‚Äôm Working On
