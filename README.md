# Hi there, I'm Brisa! 👋

I'm a **Bioengineer** by education (in process, hopefully by next July) and a **Software Engineer** by experience. I'm passionate about leveraging technology to enhance healthcare. I currently work at **Solvd** as a team lead on my project, where I focus on software development and team collaboration. With a commitment to problem-solving, I aim to create impactful solutions. I'm hoping to gain more hard skills experience and, someday, apply it in healthcare tech development.

## 🎓 Education
- **Bioengineer, Instituto Tecnológico de Buenos Aires, Argentina**

## 🤝 Volunteering
- In my free time, I lead a diverse team at the **IEEE ITBA Student Branch**, part of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), which is a global organization dedicated to advancing technology for humanity. At IEEE ITBA, we organize programming courses and tech competitions, fostering skill development and collaboration among students. It’s a fantastic way to engage with the community, learn new things, and inspire others in the field of technology!
